I'm done.  In the age of AI, I'm tired.  I'm tired of large companies stealing my work and contributing nothing.  I'm tired of vibe coders asking questions and complaining things don't work because AI gave them an old version and they don't know how to read docs or think.  I'm tired of getting almost no help while demands constantly increase.  I'm just... tired.

If you'd like to offer to take over as a maintainer, I'll say no thanks.  I'm not willing to create a supply chain attack vector for the users of my stuff.  Feel free to fork it if you'd like to keep it going.  I'm archiving, not deleting.
